This is an example project which uses couchdyno as a dependency.

`./build.sh` fetches couchdyno as a dependency.

Then run ./mytest.py which imports and uses "rep" module to run a simple test.

Dyno dependency is specified as a version tag in Github. When deploying to a test server, make sure it has read access to the repo.
